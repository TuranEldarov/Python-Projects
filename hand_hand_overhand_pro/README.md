In my country, Azerbaijan, there is a hand game generally used as a fair choosing method among three people. It is called 'hand, hand, overhand', and it closely resembles the universal game 'rock, paper, scissors.'



So, how is it played? Three people place their hands on top of each other and simultaneously shake them while shouting 'hand, hand, overhand!' Afterwards, everyone removes their hand and shows either the back of their hand or their palm. The player who shows a different gesture from the other two wins. If all three show the same side, it is a draw. You might wonder what happens after the first winner is chosen, because we don't know the second and third. Well, the winner joins the game again, and until the second winner is determined, they play again and again.



In this Python project, I recreated this traditional Azerbaijani hand game by using functions from 'random' module. You can challenge two NPCs to the game and see if you can become the winner!
